Quests of the Round Table Project
You will need to place the cropped images from the gentleman on CUlearn into a folder in the project directory in your eclipse to have the code working with the proper images. I also snipped a blank white image to use for temporary GUI testing purposes.

January 20th 12PM (midnight)
Ethann: Hey guys, I was able to get somewhat of the skeleton started just a bit. I was unable to get the cards showing up tonight on the GUI but am right before that step and am hoping to do more work tomorrow before and after work to get this done. Jean-Pierre had sent out an email, and we don't have to have any coding portion done for the Tuesday's 23rd class (but we have a head start for next week now), but that we need to have Features and Scenarios that test these features. I have added that Features and Scenarios document for us to add to. (this was about 4-5 hours of work including some refreshing material and getting back into the SWING of things.... get it LOL, and writing this here so it is easy to go back and see for progress reports)

January 21st 6:00PM
Sam: Refactored the git repository so all IDE's can interact with the source code, added the cropped images to the src.

January 21st 9:30PM
Eva: So I made the Weapon scenario, and it looks more like a checklist... I feel it might be hard to make it like a description of a game as the setup can just be large, and we are contributing individually. Hopefully I covered all weapon cases, but please feel free to change anything that looks not good :) I also set up a progress report folder, and write something in. In the end we can just throw the scenarios and our hours in, convert to PDF, and hand it in! - Spent 1.5 hour on this

January 22nd 2AM
Ethann: Hey Guys, added some scenarios for about an hour. No code tonight, doing some tomorrow after school sometime between 6PM and 11PM. I really liked the modeling you had for the scenarios so I rolled with something similar.

January 23 11PM
Ethann: Hey Guys, just laid some more piping for the GUI and initializer functions in the GUI-features branch. Spent about 45-60 minutes tonight. I plan to continue working on this tomorrow morning/afternoon as well and should have card labels showing up, initializer functions further developed and the other players stats showing up as well on the GUI, if .

January 24 2:30PM
Ethann: Did a bit more work on the initialize functions and added some getters and setters because I needed them to progress with the GUI. Going to be displaying cards and players info very soon. Spent about 30-45 minutes.# Quests

January 25 5:00PM
Ethann: created a Maven project with proper dependencies to Junit using tutorial from class on Jan 25. Scrapped GUI that was initially being built in swing so we can use JavaFX. Added a few of the classes we had from the other project repository. 

January 27 11:00PM
Ethann: Got the GUI working to the point to display a card. Doing the methods to display active players card and info in the front and non-active players info elsewhere on the screen will be easy but will need the classes and other things we discussed at our meeting to be somewhat implemented as well. Spent around 3-4 hours

January 29 2PM
Ethann: Got the GUI working further, adventure deck being populated with cards, and cards storing images to be later displayed. Spent about 2 hours. 


January 29 11PM
Eva: Added some Card classes, able to construct a Rank Deck without Image, and has a shuffle method. Adventure and Story Deck will follow the same pattern, so should be quick later on. Sorry I've been sick all week, about 3-4 hour work
